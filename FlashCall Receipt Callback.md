**Brief Description:**
- Callbacks will be provided via a POST interface. Customers need to develop an HTTP interface to receive callback data and configure it in the Flash Call application on the NxCloud platform. After the call is completed, the information of the call will be automatically reported to the configured callback URL.

- Callback functionality is currently not available. You can view the call records in the NxCloud platform for now.
